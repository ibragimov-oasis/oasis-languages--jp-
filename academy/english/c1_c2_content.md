## Advanced Verb Tenses and Aspects

### Future Perfect Continuous

**Structure:** will have been + verb-ing

Used to emphasize the duration of an action that will be ongoing up to a specific point in the future.

**Examples:**
- By next month, I will have been working here for ten years.
- In 2025, they will have been researching this phenomenon for two decades.
- By the time you arrive, I'll have been waiting for three hours.

**Advanced Usage:**
- Often used with time expressions: by then, by the time, for X years
- Emphasizes continuity and duration rather than completion

### Past Perfect Continuous

**Structure:** had been + verb-ing

Emphasizes the duration of an action that continued up to another past action.

**Examples:**
- I had been studying for hours when he finally called.
- They had been living in Paris for five years before they moved to London.
- The company had been losing money for months before it declared bankruptcy.

**Distinction from Past Perfect:**
- Past Perfect: focuses on completion (I had finished the report)
- Past Perfect Continuous: focuses on duration (I had been working on the report)

### Mixed Conditionals

Combining different time references in conditional sentences.

**Type 1: Past condition, present result**
Structure: If + past perfect, would + base verb

**Examples:**
- If I had studied medicine, I would be a doctor now.
- If she had invested in that company, she would be rich today.
- If we had left earlier, we wouldn't be stuck in traffic.

**Type 2: Present condition, past result**
Structure: If + past simple, would have + past participle

**Examples:**
- If I were more organized, I wouldn't have missed the deadline.
- If she understood Spanish, she would have enjoyed the movie more.
