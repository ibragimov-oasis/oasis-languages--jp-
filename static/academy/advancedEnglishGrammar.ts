# Advanced English Grammar: From Upper-Intermediate to C2

Master sophisticated English grammar structures to achieve C2 proficiency, IELTS 9, and TOEFL 110+ scores.

## Introduction

At the advanced level (C1-C2), English grammar mastery goes beyond avoiding basic errors. You need to demonstrate nuanced understanding, sophisticated structure variation, and natural, native-like control of complex grammatical patterns. This guide covers the advanced grammar structures essential for achieving the highest levels of English proficiency.

## Part 1: Advanced Verb Tenses and Aspects

### Future Perfect Continuous

**Structure:** will have been + verb-ing

Used to emphasize the duration of an action that will be ongoing up to a specific point in the future.

**Examples:**
- By next month, I will have been working here for ten years.
- In 2025, they will have been researching this phenomenon for two decades.
- By the time you arrive, I'll have been waiting for three hours.

**Advanced Usage:**
- Often used with time expressions: by then, by the time, for X years
- Emphasizes continuity and duration rather than completion

### Past Perfect Continuous

**Structure:** had been + verb-ing

Emphasizes the duration of an action that continued up to another past action.

**Examples:**
- I had been studying for hours when he finally called.
- They had been living in Paris for five years before they moved to London.
- The company had been losing money for months before it declared bankruptcy.

**Distinction from Past Perfect:**
- Past Perfect: focuses on completion (I had finished the report)
- Past Perfect Continuous: focuses on duration (I had been working on the report)

### Mixed Conditionals

Combining different time references in conditional sentences.

**Type 1: Past condition, present result**
Structure: If + past perfect, would + base verb

**Examples:**
- If I had studied medicine, I would be a doctor now.
- If they had invested earlier, they would be wealthy today.
- If she hadn't missed that flight, she would be in Paris right now.

**Type 2: Present/general condition, past result**
Structure: If + past simple, would have + past participle

**Examples:**
- If I were more organized, I wouldn't have forgotten the meeting.
- If he spoke French, he would have understood the conversation.

---

## Part 2: Advanced Modal Verbs

### Modal Perfects for Deduction

**Must have + past participle (Strong certainty about the past):**
- She must have left already. (I'm almost certain she left.)
- They must have forgotten about the meeting.

**Can't/couldn't have + past participle (Strong impossibility):**
- He can't have finished the project already. (It's impossible.)
- She couldn't have known about the surprise party.

**May/might/could have + past participle (Possibility in the past):**
- She may have taken the wrong bus. (It's possible.)
- They might have already heard the news.
- He could have been delayed by traffic.

**Should/ought to have + past participle (Expectation or advice not followed):**
- You should have told me earlier. (You didn't, and it was wrong.)
- They ought to have consulted an expert.

**Would have + past participle (Hypothetical past):**
- I would have helped if I had known. (But I didn't know.)
- She would have succeeded with proper training.

### Sophisticated Modal Usage

**Epistemic modals (expressing degrees of certainty):**
- **Will:** He'll be at home by now. (Strong assumption)
- **Should:** She should be arriving soon. (Expectation)
- **May/might:** They might have left already. (Possibility)
- **Must:** You must be exhausted. (Logical deduction)
- **Can't:** That can't be true. (Logical impossibility)

## Part 3: Subjunctive Mood

The subjunctive is essential for formal and academic English.

### Present Subjunctive

**Structure:** Base form of verb (same for all persons)

**Used after verbs of suggestion, recommendation, demand, request:**
- suggest, recommend, propose, insist, demand, request, require, ask

**Examples:**
- I suggest that he **study** harder. (not "studies")
- She insists that the meeting **be** postponed. (not "is")
- They recommend that applicants **submit** their documents early.
- It is essential that every student **attend** the orientation.

**Common patterns:**
- It is crucial/essential/vital/imperative that + subject + base verb
- I propose/suggest/recommend that + subject + base verb

### Were-Subjunctive

Used for hypothetical or contrary-to-fact situations.

**Examples:**
- If I **were** you, I would accept the offer. (not "was")
- I wish I **were** taller. (not "was")
- She acts as if she **were** the boss. (not "was")
- Suppose he **were** to resign tomorrow...

**Advanced usage:**
- "Were" is used for all persons in formal subjunctive
- "Was" is increasingly accepted in informal contexts for "I/he/she/it"

---

## Part 4: Inversion

Inversion creates emphasis and formality in English.

### Negative Inversion

After negative adverbials at the beginning of a sentence.

**Common negative adverbials:**
- Never, rarely, seldom, hardly, barely, scarcely
- Not only, no sooner, under no circumstances, at no time
- Little, only then, only when, only after

**Structure:** Negative adverbial + auxiliary verb + subject + main verb

**Examples:**
- **Never have I seen** such a beautiful sunset.
- **Rarely does she** complain about her workload.
- **Not only did he fail** the exam, but he also lost his scholarship.
- **Under no circumstances should you** reveal this information.
- **Hardly had we left** when it started raining.
- **No sooner had she arrived** than the phone rang.
- **Little did I know** that this would change my life.
- **Only when the results came** did we understand the impact.

### Inversion After "Only"

**Examples:**
- **Only after** several attempts **did we succeed**.
- **Only by working together can we** achieve our goals.
- **Only when** you've experienced it yourself **will you understand**.
- **Only then did I realize** my mistake.

### Conditional Inversion

Formal alternative to "if" in conditionals.

**Examples:**
- **Had I known** earlier, I would have come. (= If I had known)
- **Were she here**, she would disagree. (= If she were here)
- **Should you need** any assistance, please contact us. (= If you should need)

### Inversion with "So" and "Such"

**Examples:**
- **So impressive was his presentation that** everyone applauded.
- **Such was his dedication that** he never missed a day of work.

---

## Part 5: Participle Clauses

Advanced writers use participle clauses to create concise, sophisticated sentences.

### Present Participle Clauses

**Replacing "because/as" (reason):**
- **Being a vegetarian**, she doesn't eat meat. (= Because she is a vegetarian)
- **Not having a car**, I take public transportation. (= Because I don't have a car)

**Replacing "when/while" (time):**
- **Walking down the street**, I saw an old friend. (= While I was walking)
- **Having finished** my work, I went home. (= After I had finished)

**Replacing relative clauses:**
- The man **standing by the door** is my uncle. (= who is standing)
- Anyone **wanting more information** should contact the office. (= who wants)

### Past Participle Clauses

**Passive meaning:**
- **Written in 1859**, this novel is still relevant today. (= which was written)
- **Born in Italy**, he moved to France as a child. (= He was born)
- **Exhausted by the journey**, they went straight to bed. (= Because they were exhausted)

### Perfect Participle Clauses

**Structure:** Having + past participle

Indicates that one action was completed before another.

**Examples:**
- **Having completed** the course, she applied for the job. (= After she had completed)
- **Having never been** to Asia, I was excited about the trip. (= Because I had never been)
- **Not having received** a response, we sent another email. (= Because we hadn't received)

---

## Part 6: Cleft Sentences

Cleft sentences emphasize specific information.

### It-Clefts

**Structure:** It + be + emphasized element + that/who + rest of sentence

**Examples:**
- **It was John who** broke the window. (emphasizing John)
- **It is efficiency that** matters most in business. (emphasizing efficiency)
- **It was in 1969 that** humans first landed on the moon. (emphasizing the year)
- **It's the principle that** I care about, not the money. (emphasizing the principle)

### What-Clefts (Pseudo-Clefts)

**Structure:** What + subject + verb + be + emphasized element

**Examples:**
- **What I need is** a good night's sleep. (emphasizing what is needed)
- **What annoys me is** his constant lateness. (emphasizing what annoys)
- **What we should do is** consult an expert. (emphasizing what should be done)
- **What matters most is** your happiness. (emphasizing what matters)

### Reversed What-Clefts

**Structure:** Emphasized element + be + what + subject + verb

**Examples:**
- A good night's sleep **is what I need**.
- His constant lateness **is what annoys me**.
- Consulting an expert **is what we should do**.

## Part 7: Advanced Passive Constructions

### Passive with Reporting Verbs

**Structure 1:** It + passive reporting verb + that + clause

**Examples:**
- **It is believed that** the economy will improve.
- **It has been suggested that** climate change is accelerating.
- **It is said that** she speaks five languages.
- **It was reported that** several people were injured.

**Structure 2:** Subject + passive reporting verb + to-infinitive

**Examples:**
- The economy **is believed to be improving**.
- Climate change **is suggested to be accelerating**.
- She **is said to speak** five languages.
- Several people **were reported to have been injured**.

### Get-Passive

More informal and dynamic than be-passive.

**Examples:**
- I **got fired** last week. (more personal than "was fired")
- She **got promoted** to manager. (emphasizes the change)
- Our car **got stolen** last night. (emphasizes the unfortunate event)

**Note:** Get-passive often implies something happened to the subject, sometimes unexpectedly.

### Have Something Done (Causative)

**Structure:** have/get + object + past participle

**Examples:**
- I'm **having my hair cut** tomorrow. (Someone will cut my hair.)
- She **had her car repaired** last week. (Someone repaired her car.)
- We need to **get the house painted**. (We'll arrange for someone to paint it.)

---

## Part 8: Nominalisation

Converting verbs/adjectives into nouns makes writing more formal and academic.

### Examples:

**Verb → Noun:**
- discover → discovery
- arrive → arrival
- fail → failure
- decide → decision
- conclude → conclusion

**Adjective → Noun:**
- accurate → accuracy
- different → difference
- important → importance
- efficient → efficiency

**In context:**
- **Less formal:** When we discovered the solution, it changed everything.
- **More formal:** The **discovery** of the solution changed everything.

- **Less formal:** It's important that we act quickly.
- **More formal:** The **importance** of quick action cannot be overstated.

- **Less formal:** The company failed because it wasn't efficient.
- **More formal:** The company's **failure** resulted from a lack of **efficiency**.

---

## Part 9: Discourse Markers

Advanced English uses sophisticated discourse markers.

### Listing and Sequencing
- **First and foremost**, we must address the budget.
- **In the first place**, I never agreed to this.
- **Subsequently**, several changes were implemented.
- **Ultimately**, the decision proved correct.

### Adding Information
- **Moreover**, the data supports this conclusion.
- **Furthermore**, there are additional factors to consider.

### Cause and Effect
- **Consequently**, profits declined sharply.
- **As a result of this**, new policies were implemented.
- **Therefore**, further research is necessary.
- **Hence**, the conclusion seems inevitable.
- **Accordingly**, we have revised our estimates.

### Emphasis

## Part 10: Hedging Language

Academic and formal English uses hedging to express caution and avoid overgeneralization.

### Modal Verbs

### Adverbs
- The data **apparently** indicates a trend.

## Part 11: Ellipsis and Substitution

Advanced speakers use ellipsis (omission) and substitution for concise communication.

**After auxiliary verbs:**
- A: Are you coming to the party?
- B: I might [come to the party]. (ellipsis)

- A: Have you finished the report?
- B: No, but I will [finish it] soon. (ellipsis)

---

## Part 12: Complex Sentence Structures

### Embedded Questions

**Examples:**
- I wonder **what time the meeting starts**. (not "what time does the meeting start")
- Can you tell me **where the station is**? (not "where is the station")
- She asked **whether we had finished**. (indirect question)
- I don't know **why he left**. (embedded question)

**Note:** Embedded questions use statement word order, not question order.

### Relative Clauses with Prepositions

**Formal:** The issue **about which** we are concerned is complex.
**Informal:** The issue **(that/which)** we are concerned **about** is complex.

**Formal:** The person **to whom** I spoke was very helpful.
**Informal:** The person **(who/that)** I spoke **to** was very helpful.

### Non-Defining Relative Clauses

**Examples:**
- My brother, **who lives in London**, is visiting next week.
- The report, **which was published yesterday**, contains surprising findings.
- Shakespeare, **whose plays are performed worldwide**, was born in 1564.

**Note:** These clauses add extra information and require commas.

## Conclusion

Mastering C2-level grammar requires:

1. **Accurate use of complex structures** - Perfect conditionals, inversions, subjunctives
2. **Sophisticated variation** - Using participle clauses, cleft sentences, nominalisation
3. **Appropriate register** - Knowing when to use formal vs. informal structures
4. **Natural fluency** - Using advanced structures without hesitation
5. **Precision in meaning** - Understanding subtle differences in modal usage, aspect, etc.

Keep practicing these structures in context through:
- Reading academic journals and quality newspapers
- Writing essays using varied sentence structures
- Listening to lectures and formal presentations
- Speaking in academic or professional contexts

Remember: C2 proficiency is not about using complex grammar constantly, but about having the full range of structures available and using them appropriately and naturally.

Best of luck with your advanced English studies!
